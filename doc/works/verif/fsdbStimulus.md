## Use Cases
This utility could be used in certain cases like
* Exporting failure to an IP company. One can't export the SOC test for the purpose, one can just export the IP level FSDB. Then FSDB could be used to recreate the failure.
* Exporting failure to tool vendors.
* Testbench got modified or seed doesn't reproduce an earlier failure. So, one can use the failure FSDB as a stimulus to recreate the condition.
