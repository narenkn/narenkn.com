title: Knowledge worth sharing
---
  There are so much knowledge we accumulate during our career. Sometimes, it would be a solution that could benefit many. Having a GitHub repository was a start, but didn't get visibility. So, with this site, I wish I could help someone. And by doing so, I suppose they could elevate themselves to solve bigger problems and make the world a bit more better for others.

  I'm a VLSI engineer by profession. I've worked in different areas such as RTL design, DFT, Verification and Emulation.

  An engineer to another : Documentation would be limited and reading of supplimental documentations is adviced!

  *DISCLAIMER* : Use my work at your own risk! I can't be held responsible for any outcome of reusing my work.

# [VLSI Verification](/works/verif/)
  Verification is a collective term for all methods and means to assure that pre-manufactured integrated circuit meets its specifications and has very high probability to work as expected when manufactured.

# [Hardware Emulation](/works/emu/)
  Emulation is pre-silicon validation of digital circuit with the use of acceleration techniques like FPGA or with massively parallel processors.

# [Embedded Systems](/works/embedded/)
  Microcontrollers, microprocessors ... and their generic applications.
