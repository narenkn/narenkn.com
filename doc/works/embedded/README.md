# Embedded Systems
Here are some of my enthusiast projects accomplished during the available time out of work. These were done over different periods of time. I"m hopeful that it would serve as help or reference to anybody who's looking for similar knowledge. I would like to encourage students and educators to adapt these works if required and achieve over what I've already done.

Best Luck!! Have a great Day!!
